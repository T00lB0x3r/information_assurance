# Hey, first of all, thanks for taking the time to read this! (the preview way is ugly, so you should read this in the code form)

# I will primarily be using GitHub as a housing place for all of the reports I write on various projects.
# The class this repository is based on is my Information Assurance Class. The class has 5 labs which are: 

#   1.  Install and Explore Kali Linux (name truly doesn't do this lab justice)
#     - this lab involved me exploiting a metasploitable VM, while also analyzing the effects of the exploit, nmap, and masscan all within Wireshark.
#     - it was super fun and incredible informative.
#   2.  Certificate Authority
#   3. **Yet to be determined
#   4. **Yet to be determined
#   5. **Yet to be determined

# So, yea, thanks again for reading and you should totally give me the job, internship, or scholarship I'm applying to.
